# DistributedSorting
It's a simple distributed application developed by Hongzhong Yu and tested by Junyan Li. The readme file only introduce the function for those files. The more details of the design and implementation part of our project can be found in Distributed_Sorting.pdf, which is our report of this lab project.
### Function of the files

#### distributed_sorting.cpp:
This is the implementation part of our design. It can finish all the running part in our work.
#### distributed_sorting_small.cpp:
This is the implementation part of the design alternative. It can also finish the running part in the work. We will choose to use it based on the platformand slave nodes we have.
#### config.txt and config.cpp:
We can input the setting of file road, data to sort and some other things in config.txt. The config.cpp will generate all the command into .sh file and the code of sorting application in to dsort.cpp.
#### dsort.cpp datagen.sh dataval.sh mpirun.sh:
These files are generated by config.cpp. They are the code and commands needed to run.
#### gensort and valsort:
Tools provided by sorting benchmark.
#### run.sh:
It will run all the process with echoing some information for the steps.
